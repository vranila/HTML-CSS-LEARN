HTML Style Best Practices

1. Declare Document Type:
Always start with <!DOCTYPE html> to define the HTML5 standard.

2. Use Lowercase for Elements and Attributes:
Stick to lowercase for all element and attribute names for readability, consistency, and ease of maintenance.

3. Close All Elements:
Even if optional, always close tags (e.g., <p></p>) to avoid rendering and browser inconsistencies.

4. Quote Attribute Values:
Always enclose attribute values in quotes — required if values contain spaces.

5. Use alt, width, and height for Images:
Include alt for accessibility and width/height to prevent layout shifts.

6. Maintain Clean Syntax:
No unnecessary spaces around = in attributes (e.g., href="style.css").
Keep code lines short — avoid horizontal scrolling.

7. Proper Indentation & Spacing:
Use two spaces, not tabs. Add blank lines between logical sections for readability.

8. Always Include <title>:
Required for SEO, browser tab labels, and bookmarks. Keep it descriptive and relevant.

9. Include <html>, <head>, and <body> Tags:
While optional, omitting them can cause browser or software issues. Always include for stability.

10. Close Empty Elements if Needed:
Optional in HTML (<meta>), but add / if XML compatibility is required.

11. Specify Language and Encoding:
Use <html lang="en-us"> and <meta charset="UTF-8"> for accessibility and proper character rendering.

12. Set the Viewport:
Include <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> for responsive design.

13. Comment Cleanly:
Short comments on one line, long comments indented and multi-line for visibility.

14. Use External Stylesheets:
Link with <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">.
Keep CSS formatted — braces aligned, properties indented, semicolons after every rule.

15. Load JavaScript Simply:
Use <script src="myscript.js"></script> — omit type="text/javascript".

16. Respect Case Sensitivity in File Names:
Use lowercase file names (index.html, style.css, etc.) to prevent server conflicts.

17. File Extensions:
HTML → .html (or .htm)
CSS → .css
JavaScript → .js

18. Default Filenames:
Use index.html as the homepage file to align with server defaults.
